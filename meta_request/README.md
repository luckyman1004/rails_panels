# MetaRequest

Supporting gem for [Rails Panel (Google Chrome extension for Rails development)](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel).

## Installation

Add meta_request gem to development group in Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'meta_request'
end
```

## Usage

See [Rails Panel extension](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel).

## Compatibility Warnings

If you're using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) or
[Rack::LiveReload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload) make sure to
exclude watching your tmp/ folder because meta_request writes a lot of data there
and your browser will refresh like a madman.

## Configuration

Gem can be configured using block:

```ruby
MetaRequest.configure do |config|
  config.storage_pool_size = 30
end
```

List of available attributes and defaults can be found in [lib/meta_request/config.rb](lib/meta_request/config.rb).

## Docker

Apps runing in Docker container will have filepaths of the container so links to editor would not work. To fix this, you need to propagate working directory through enviroment variable `SOURCE_PATH`. With docker-compose it can be done like this:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - SOURCE_PATH=$PWD
    # ...
```

## Development

Run all tests:

    docker-compose up
